Get a number from the user.
Check the number to see if it is the correct range.
If not, get another number.
If it is, continue on.

raise the number to the fourth power.

print the result.

We need these variables:
-input 
-result 

We need these constants:
-power 
-minimum value 
-maximum value 

we need the following libraries:
-iostream 
-cmath 

#####################
##  pseudo code:   ##
#####################

# initialize POWER, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM as doubles 
# initialize input, result as doubles  

# prompt the user to enter a number in the valid range
# store the number in input 

# call pow() on input and set result to the return value 

# print the value of the input after it is raised
